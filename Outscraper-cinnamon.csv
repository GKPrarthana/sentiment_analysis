"We stayed here for 2 days on Bed and Breakfast. We got a card offer. You can look out for offers that pop up for local credit cards.
The room is fantastic. We had a room overlooking the lake and we had a great view.
The breakfast is really good. Had plenty of options to select from.
For dinner we went to the Long Feng Chinese restaurant located inside the hotel. Which gives a variety of food options within the hotel.
Service is good. For Sri Lankans the amount of sure they give in the room may be low. Dont forget to request if you want more, their service is great.
Highly recommended if you are planning to explore Colombo. It's located near many great locations."
"A hotel with perfect view and perfect service. Danushka was my service room Responsible , he was amazing"

"Good food and good service. Thank you Mohemed Rizvan, Lakmali, Sudeepa for your great service …"
Wonderful experience ! My son's 01st birthday was on 5th May. Awesome 👌 service of Mr Lakmal and his team at 8 degree by the Cinnamon Lakeside 👏 🙌 👌 I really appreciate the food as well and even the coordination done by Mr Arshad banquet assistant sales manager
This was such a memorable stay as we came back to the same hotel that we got married after 6 years to celebrate our Wedding Anniversary. The team had sent a surprise Anniversary cake with a pack of goodies to our room. The little details like accommodating a baby crib (before even requesting one) as we were with an infant has to be highly appreciated. I would say that both me and my wife felt very well taken care of by team Cinnamon Lakeside. Special Thanks to Warren Hakel for making the arrangements for us and providing such a memorable stay. Cinnamon Lakeside was always a special place for us and will remain the same.
"Muhammed Rizwan, Ajith and Ridmi from Goodies were very attentive. Great service."
We recently had the High Tea buffet at Cinnamon Lakeside and it was good் and hopefully bring more options.
"Best high tea in town. Highly recommend
Special thanks to Sanjeeva, hirushani and Rithushi"

"Our cricket tour group of over 40 recently had the pleasure of staying at the exquisite Cinnamon Lakeside in Colombo, Sri Lanka, and it was an experience that exceeded all expectations. Situated amidst the vibrant cityscape of Colombo and overlooking the serene Beira Lake, this luxurious hotel provided the perfect blend of comfort, convenience, and hospitality for our group. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with warmth and professionalism by the hotel staff, who ensured that our check-in process was smooth and efficient. Despite our large numbers, the staff handled our arrival with ease, making us feel welcome and valued from the outset.

The accommodations at Cinnamon Lakeside were nothing short of spectacular. Our rooms were spacious, elegantly appointed, and offered stunning views of either the lake or the city skyline. After a long day of cricket matches and exploration, returning to the comfort of our rooms felt like a true retreat.

One of the highlights of our stay was the exceptional dining experience offered by the hotel. Cinnamon Lakeside boasts a diverse range of restaurants and bars, each offering a unique culinary journey. From authentic Sri Lankan cuisine to international specialties, there was something to satisfy every palate. The quality of the food and the attentive service made each meal a memorable occasion for our group.

In addition to the luxurious accommodations and dining experiences, Cinnamon Lakeside also offered a wealth of amenities and facilities to keep our group entertained. Whether it was relaxing by the pool, indulging in a spa treatment, or exploring the nearby attractions, there was never a dull moment during our stay.

Overall, our experience at Cinnamon Lakeside was nothing short of exceptional. The combination of luxurious accommodations, world-class dining, and impeccable service made it the perfect retreat for our cricket tour group. We are grateful to the staff for their hospitality and professionalism and look forward to returning to this urban oasis in the heart of Colombo in the future."
Nice place nice meals
"""I recently stayed at Cinnamon Lake Colombo and had a fantastic experience from start to finish. The room was impeccably clean and cozy, with a comfortable bed that ensured a great night's sleep. The staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating, going above and beyond to make my stay enjoyable. I particularly appreciated Duty Manager Kasun & Nathaali. Can't forget the service and the Smile on Saajali's face.Thank you soo much.
The hotel's location was convenient, and the amenities provided added extra comfort to my stay. I would highly recommend [Hotel Name] to anyone looking for a memorable and relaxing stay.""
I do recommend 100% to stay in Cinnamon Lakeside Colombo"
"We came from Sydney- Australia.||Cinnamon Lakeside is excellent in every way. We came for my neice's wedding and the reception hall, the roomsand the entire hotel was above our expectations.| From the warm welcome by the staff to the exquisitely designed rooms offering breathtaking views of the lake and city. |We went to the Library Restaurant for Karaoke, pool & music in the lobby. It's undoubtedly one of the best hotels for tourists and locals. |Sri Lanka is the place for tourism."
"I enjoyed my stay at cinnamon lakiside ,a wonderful property.the from office staff especially Travis .kasoon and Waroon , wonderful human beings,they mader our staff even more comfortable and memorable.A BIG 5 Star to you guys........||||Thank you ||Hope to come bk again"
Mohammed Rizawan
High tea is not worth for the price and no much selection compared to price. It’s just tricky.
A good place to buy cakes and sandwiches. A nice lobby Mohameed rizwan gives us a good service.
"Hard woker very good servicer Mohamed Rizwan nice 🙂 smiling 😊 pastry super ather staff wassane,ushan, kammali,nadeeshani all so good 😊 best five star ⭐ hotel cinnamon lakesaid very clean 🫧 all areas"
"I checked into this amazing hotel three days before the new year. The ambiance is superb. I arrived feeling exhausted from a long flight, but one person at the reception, named Supun, made a very good first impression with his smile and professionalism. He upgraded my room to a lakeview one since I wanted to relax. It was probably my best check-in to a 5-star hotel. The hotel room and the view are amazing. I had food through room service, and it was amazing, as well as the pool. It was an amazing short stay. I will be back with my family before leaving Sri Lanka"

We were not in-house guests and came for breakfast. Amasha in particular was quite rude to us and had a very unpleasant attitude. She treats guests very selectively and has quite a rude attitude towards locals. The food however was great and apart from her encounter it was a great experience
Very good 👍 pastry 🎂 and sandwiches supper service mohammed Rizwan hard worker all areas nice 👍 clean best hotel best service 💯
Mohammed rizwan great 😊 services
Danushka was very helpful with making sure that all my needs were taken care of. This hotel is by far one of the best ones I’ve stayed at. Would definitely recommend it for people visiting Colombo.

Mohammed rizwan great service
Mohamad Rizwan
Recently ordered lunch from Flavours by Cinnamon Lakeside for a family event and highly satisfied about the wonderful service provided. The quality and the quantity of meals and the service was top notch. Highly recommended. |Special thanks to the wonderful staff and Mr. Nethma Perera ( Food Coordinator ) for the great service.
"Excellent high tea buffet at cinnamon lakeside. The spread was huge so many dessert items. And the staff was very helpful as well. Special thanks to hirushani, rithushi and nipun."
"My recent stay at Cinnamon Lakeside Colombo was nothing short of extraordinary. As soon as I stepped into the grand lobby, I was greeted with a warmth that instantly made me feel at home. It's evident from the outset that this is indeed a 5-star hotel, where hospitality is not just a service, but a genuine passion.

The culinary experience at Cinnamon Lakeside was a highlight of my stay. Every meal was a delight, offering a diverse range of flavors that satisfied even the most discerning palate. Whether indulging in local delicacies or savoring international cuisine, the food was consistently exceptional.

Moreover, my accommodations surpassed all expectations. The room was not only immaculately clean but also remarkably spacious, providing a tranquil oasis in the heart of the bustling city. The attention to detail in the room's design and amenities truly elevated the overall experience.

One of the standout features of Cinnamon Lakeside is its expansive wedding halls. The hotel offers an unparalleled setting for celebrations, with lavish spaces that can accommodate gatherings of all sizes. From intimate ceremonies to grand receptions, every event is executed with precision and elegance. And of course, the culinary offerings for these events are nothing short of spectacular, adding an extra layer of joy to every occasion.

In summary, my time at Cinnamon Lakeside Colombo was nothing short of exceptional. From the moment I arrived until the moment I departed, every aspect of my experience was infused with warmth, luxury, and unparalleled hospitality. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough and look forward to my next visit eagerly."

Mohamed rizwan.  Excellent services
Had a wonderful stay last week at the hotel. Beautiful hotel with the friendliest staff and most conveniently located. The Thai restaurant on site was awesome.
"Superb service, big comfortable rooms, and a great pool/gym/spa area.

I had two main issues though, first being that the food in the Dining Room was not 5 star quality, and the other being that the facilitiwa are clearly dated.

Still a great time and would be happy to stay again."

Excellent high tea buffet at cinnamon lakeside. Special thanks to hirushani and rithushi
"The dinner buffet was alright, but I'm not sure if it's worth the money. There was a wide variety of food, but the sushi did not taste that good. I'm very much into sushi, and the ones here disappointed me greatly. The soy sauce tasted too salty and weird. I loved the lamb, and the desserts were pretty good too. I feel like there's a lot of room for improvement regarding the quality of food."
good service
Very Friendly & good service
goodies is wonderful and very accommodating of allergy requirements. Mohamed Rizwan helped me find soy milk for my cappuccino when the others said there isn’t any. And the female chef at the sandwich stand Niseni was very accommodating and helpful in making me a gluten free dairy free sandwich with care. Thankyou for a happy experience!
Mohammed Rizwan - Service
Was at goodies and service of all the staff was excellent. Mohommed Rizwan was so supportive and helpful.

"It’s indeed a 5* hotel,
Amazing nice lobby, with a warm welcome.
Great food during my stay, and clean and a spacious room.
Why then 4* and not 5*
It’s a bit a boring hotel.

As soon some people make some fun at the pool. Staff request them to calm down.
Some more “fun” at a pool area would be better.
Maybe some chilling music would add some value"
"Went for dinner buffet.
The food was very good, pleasant atmosphere, good arrangement. Service also excellent"
"Super Service, sehr freundliches zuvorkommendes Personal, Essen große Auswahl und super lecker, sehr gute Lage,||sehr sauber, schöne große Zimmer mit tollem Ausblick zum See, schöner Pool mit toller Poolbar||"

"Great service from Goodies restaurant and enjoyable  time
Special thanks for Prageeth and Ridmi"
"We stayed here in the start, and at the end of our trip in Sri lanka. Definitely one of the better hotels in Colombo with probably the best view of the lake. The service is 5stars , especially the rooms service and reception. I also have to add the Cinnamon hotels have the best mattress and pillows for a good nights sleep.
My only feedback for improvement is the rooms is a bit dated and in need of a refurbishment."
Good service by Mohamed Rizwan
"The view outside the window is great, you can directly see the Lotus Tower. Your luggage needs to be checked at the door, so security is guaranteed. The hotel staff are very friendly and will answer any questions patiently. Especially the ladies in the hotel are all wearing beautiful saris. The breakfast was great. The guy who made the rice cakes said hello to us in Chinese when he heard that we were from China. The guy who does the cleaning is also very nice. I also caught up with a local’s wedding the next day~"
"one of the most horrible hotel to deal with. After a function have to go after miserably to get a small refund sorted.
Banquet hall Arshad is no good at all.
Do better guys!!!"
"One of the best in town for an afternoon experience.
QUALITY....SERVICE & VALUE."

"Las habitaciones y su ubicación está muy bien, pero el servicio del restaurante deja mucho que desear. No es normal que pidas una cerveza para comer antes de empezar la comida y te la traigan cuando ya estas en el postre y que luego te pongan cara de extrañeza cuando se la devuelves."

"Dinner buffet at lakeside is totally worth the hype. Price is reasonable to the variety of food they cater. The staff is friendly and the service is also good.

Dinner buffet Per head was 7500/- but we targeted a 20% off and it only costed 6000/- per head.

Just a hint - Do look into the bank card offers and visit the place to get yourself a bit of a relief off the price."
Mohomed rizwan served us well.
Mohomad Rizwan. 👌🔥❤

"When you are looking for an outstanding hotel experience this is your go to place. The staff will make you feel safe & secure at all times and really care about your wellbeing.

Mr. Vidura is one of the nicest people I‘ve met in my life. He really saved my night by helping me out of a dangerous situation that took place in front of the hotel. I wasn‘t even a hotel guest but he decided to help me feel safe and got me something to drink. He took care of my belongings and even gave me wifi access to get a taxi. But that‘s not all. He also let me know when my taxi arrived, so that I could wait inside the hotel. I feel nothing but gratefulness towards him."

"We stayed for 4 days and enjoyed ourselves with a big swimming pool and excellent gym to enjoy after a busy sightseeing time.  Rooms were very good, we had an executive room with a very comfortable bed, good facilities in room. Our room was serviced well each day by Danashua and looked great afterwards.
Breakfasts were rather busy and chaotic in a slightly cramped dining room - otherwise a good selection.  We had room Service once and that was beautifully delivered on our table setting I. The room."

"The management at this hotel truly deserves praise for their exceptional ability to uphold a serene and tranquil atmosphere amidst the bustling activity of the busiest commercial city. The luxurious and glamorous accommodations are consistently maintained, offering guests a high-class experience. Not only that, but the dining options are also top-notch with ""The Dining Table"" serving delectable and mouth-watering dishes during their international buffet breakfast, lunch, and dinner services. For those looking to indulge in a weekend lunch buffet experience, it is available for Rs. 5800/= per person starting at 12 pm in the main dining hall. In addition to the outstanding amenities and services provided, the cleanliness and upkeep of the establishment are impeccable. Not only were the service staff exceptionally attentive, but they also executed their duties with remarkable skill and finesse. Their impeccable service truly enhanced our afternoon, making it a truly enjoyable and unforgettable experience. We particularly loved the delectable Tom Yum soup and indulgent desserts – they were simply exquisite. We commend you on your outstanding work and will certainly be returning for another superb dining experience in the future. Keep up the excellent work!
Guests also have the option to request a mini bar for added convenience during their stay."

"Estuvimos en este hotel a finales de enero 2024, en un viaje familiar en el que éramos 5 personas. El hotel es muy grande y bonito, aunque las habitaciones están bastante anticuadas. Pongo tres estrellas porque tuvimos algunos problemas que cuento muy por encima.

Teníamos tres habitaciones y en una de ella no se podía entrar de la peste a humedad que había. De hecho, antes de entrar tenía puesta una tarjeta adicional para que el aire acondicionado funcionara continuamente. Así que no nos quedó otra que bajar a recepción y tratar de cambiar de habitación.

En la recepción fueron amables y nos cambiaron a otra en una planta superior. Pero problema es que en el hotel (imagino que por motivos de seguridad) sólo te dejan ir en el ascensor a la planta en la que tienes la habitación. Así que para ir de una habitación a teníamos que ir por las escaleras (que por cierto no tienen ningún control de seguridad), 5 plantas para arriba y abajo.

Pero lo más frustrante fue el trato que nos dieron en el restaurante (teníamos contratada la cena tipo buffet). Llegamos a cenar y nos dice una chica muy antipática y estirada, que no hay sitio porque está todo reservado y que nos sentemos en unas mesas que hay en un pasillo de la recepción. Evidentemente nos negamos, así que de muy mala gana y muy mala forma nos dice que nos sentemos separados. Le indicamos que somos familia y que estamos de viaje juntos. Respuesta: que es lo que hay, así que nos tuvimos que separar para poder cenar.

Lo más indignante es que la chica que acomodaba, para las personas autóctonas y que iban bien vestidos eran todo amabilidad, unía mesas y las combinaba para que se sentarán juntos, aunque no tenían reserva alguna (oímos varias veces como acordaban la distribución y ofrecía varias opciones).

Tuvimos un par de incidencias más pero no quiero cansar, así que al igual que en el caso de la boda de Boda Lucia y Choli nosotros también nos sentimos discriminados, y en nuestro caso por ser extranjeros e ir vestido de sport (sólo tratan amablemente a quien les interesa). Así que si eres turista en este hotel y no llevas la ropa adecuada (traje de chaqueta o regional) no eres bien recibido ni tratado.   La verdad es que no repetiría y eso que teníamos muchas ganas de probar algún hotel de la cadena Cinnamon."
Mohamed Rizwan took care of me very well
Good memories. Good times.
